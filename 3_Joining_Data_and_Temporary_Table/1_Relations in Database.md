### ** Relations in Database**
A relational database organizes data into tables (relations) connected by defined relationships. Each table consists of rows (records) and columns (fields).

#### **Key Concepts:**
- **Primary Key:** A unique identifier for each record in a table.
- **Foreign Key:** A field in one table that uniquely identifies a row in another table, establishing a relationship.
- **One-to-Many Relationship:** Common relation type where one record in Table A can be linked to multiple records in Table B.
